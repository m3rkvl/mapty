## Reflection

   This project was my introduction to object oriented programming in JavaScript. It was really exciting trying to wrap my head around the OOP principles and working on this project and. Editing, sorting, deleting features were super fun to implement. Lastly, communicating with multiple API's and merging their data together to present a whole package of relevant data to the user in a meaningful way was what made this project especially dear to me...
